Save the Princess

You begin the game with 4 lives. 
Use the arrow keyys on your ketboard to cross the bussy street.
Meet the princess and receives 10 points. 
Avoid all cars in the street as they will take a life away and send you back to start.
Rocks in the water are an additional obsicle. If you touch a rock you will be sent back to start.
After saving the princess you will begin again however the princess may move to  a new location along the top row.
See how many points you can score. Good Luck ! 

I used the following resources when creating the game:

Sams Teach Yourself Javascript in 24 Hours (Book) 
Jessie Warden (You Tube Videos) **Very Helpfull**
Used several tips mentioned on the Udacity Forums
Attended Udacity Weekly Office Hours for assistance

Found cars on a free clip art site and modified it using Gimp.
